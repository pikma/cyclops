'''An AI to play the 'cyclops' game.

This is a 2 player game. Each player has n coins, and there are m rounds. In
each round, both player simulatenously decide to spend some of their coins
(they can spend 0). The player who spends the most coins wins the round. If
they spend the same amount, the round is a tie. After m rounds, the player who
has won the most rounds wins the game.

This file implements the backwards-induction algorithm, see 'Algorithms for
Computing Strategies in Two-Player Simultaneous Move Games', by Bosansky et
al (http://mlanctot.info/files/papers/aij-2psimmove.pdf).
